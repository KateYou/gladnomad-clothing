gladnomad-clothing
==================

gladnomad is a clothing and accessory company.  The clothing and bags are casual, featuring designs screen-printed on mass-produced items like t-shirts, caps and string bags.  gladnomad aspires to become a lifestyle brand and plans to increase its emphasis on charitable giving and youth mentoring.  It emulates the branding and foundation giving of clothing companies Life is Good and Salt Life. 

This retail site was manually coded in Dreamweaver CS6 with JavaScript plug-ins, and included a Main page with image slider, an About page describing their mission, a page to spotlight their artist, and also a storefront.  Graphics included images of the clothing and block prints submitted by the company. I scaled these images in Photoshop, and also selected beach images from Creative Commons material consistent with the company brand for use in the slider.  

We ultimately chose to not go live with this site, and instead used a template site which already included the php and security needed for tracking a shopping cart.  I used frequent facebook and twitter widgets on that site, as the company often attends festivals and likes to keep their social media presence lively and up-to-date.
